"This class is the main developer interface to Recurrance.  It actually contains a 
list of RecurranceRule objects and uses them to fill the same set of methods as
RecurranceRule.  The difference is that you may union together more that one rule
using this object.

This class will eventually be able to handle the union and intersection of rules.
For now, it just holds the one rule."
