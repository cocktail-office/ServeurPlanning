"By night one way, BYDAY another...
Represents a day of the week and OPTIONALLY which count of that day of the week.
For values of count:
	-N means the Nth last given week day in the unit of measure
	 0 means all given week days in the unit of measure
	+N means the Nth first given week day in the unit of measure
If you think this should be a bean, I encourage you to suck on one."
